        <p>
          Cookies are small files of data in the form of text files created by
          web browsers you may use and is stored on your device’s hard drive.
          They allow website providers to identify users, store preferential
          information, and understand users’ browsing activities. There are
          other similar technologies (as specified below) that allow us and
          third parties to obtain information about your visits to the Site,
          usage of the Platform, including to analyze your visiting patterns. We
          use this information to provide Services on the Platform and messages
          and content for us and others that are specific to your interests.
        </p>
        <h2>Cookies and Similar Technologies – General Information</h2>
        <p>
          There are two main types of cookies: First-party cookies which are set
          by ScholarSense directly when you use our Site, and third-party
          cookies which are set by other websites, such as that of certain
          third-party services providers whose platform may be integrated with
          our Platform to facilitate Services to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies alone cannot be used to disclose your individual identity to
          us, though in some cases we may tie ScholarSense’s or third-party
          cookies to personal information you have provided to us or that we
          have otherwise obtained about you in accordance with our Privacy
          Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies are used to improve your experience of the Platform. For
          example, we may use cookies to – (a) remember your username and
          password for future visits so that log-in is easier and faster; (b)
          track your response to Platform content for analysis; (c) measure how
          many people use the Platform, and how they use it, so that we may keep
          it running quickly and efficiently; and (d) help us and others deliver
          communications and content to you that are relevant and responsive to
          your interests and location.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other technologies that may be used include web beacons, which are
          tiny graphics that are used to understand browsing activity; social
          widgets - these are buttons or icons provided by third-party social
          media providers that allow you to interact with social media services
          when you view a webpage or mobile app screen. These social widgets may
          collect browsing data, which may be received by the third party that
          provided the widget and are controlled by third parties; UTM codes are
          strings that can appear in a URL (the “Uniform Resource Locator,”
          which is typically the http or https address entered to go to a web
          page) when you move from one web page or website to another, where the
          string can represent information about browsing, such as which
          advertisement, page, or publisher sent the user to the receiving
          website; and site optimization and usage tracking.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may contract with third party service providers to help manage and
          optimize our internet business and communications, and these
          third-party service providers may also use the technologies described
          in this section to collect certain information.
