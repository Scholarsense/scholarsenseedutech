      <h2 className="">APPLICABILITY</h2>
      <p>
        This Policy applies to all Users of the Platform. <br />
        ScholarSense along with its holding, affiliate, and group companies, owns and/or manages several platforms (other than the Platform) that offer a range of services including services related to technology solutions in the space of online and offline learnings, (“ <strong>Group Platforms</strong>”). Each of the Group Platforms has published its own privacy policies. Accordingly, this Policy does not apply to information collected through the Group Platforms and only applies to the collection of your information through the Platform. Please visit the relevant Group Platform to know the privacy practices undertaken by them.

      <h2 className="">ACCESS</h2>
      <p>
        You may be allowed to access and view the Platform as a guest and without creating an account on the Platform or providing any Personal Information. We may allow you to avail certain services without the need for your registration, but you may be required to submit certain Personal Information and other information to avail such services. However, to have access to all the features and benefits on our Platform, you are required to first create an account on our Platform. To create an account, you are required to provide certain Personal Information as may be required during the time of registration and all other information requested on the registration page, including the information to receive promotional offers from ScholarSense (which may be optional). ScholarSense may, in future, include other optional requests for information from you to help ScholarSense customize the Platform to deliver personalized information to you.

        As stated in our Terms and Conditions, to register on the Platform you must meet the 'Age Requirements' (as defined in our Terms and Conditions). If you are a <strong>“Minor”</strong> or <strong>“Child”</strong> i.e., an individual who does not meet the Age Requirements, then you may not register on the Platform, and only your Parent (defined below) can register on the Platform on your behalf, agree to all Platform Terms and enable access to you under their guidance and supervision.

        While some of our Services may require collection of a Child's Personal Information, we do not knowingly collect such Personal Information from a Child. Our Platform may be accessed only by and under the supervision of the Parent(s) of a Child and accordingly, we believe that a Child's Personal Information has been provided to us by and with the consent of the Parent. If you are a Parent and you are aware that your Child has provided us with any Personal Information without your consent, please contact us at <a href="mailto:feedback@ScholarSense.com">feedback@ScholarSense.com</a>. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from a Child in the absence of consent of the Parent, we will take steps to remove such information from our servers.
